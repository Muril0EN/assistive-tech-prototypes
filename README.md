# Assistive Technology: Hardware & Software Lab 🦾🧬

This repository hosts a collection of projects focused on low-level programming, software architecture, and hardware-software interfacing. These projects represent my technical foundation in C/C++ and embedded systems, bridging the gap between pure logic and physical interaction.

## 📂 Featured Modules

### 🤖 Hardware & Robotics (C++ / Arduino)
* **Robotic Arm Controller:** A mechatronic system utilizing an Arduino to control a 4-DOF arm. 
    * **Focus:** PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control, analog-to-digital mapping, and smooth kinematic movement.
* **Interactive Memory Game:** A hardware implementation of sequence logic.
    * **Focus:** Finite State Machines (FSM) for game flow management and debounce logic for tactile inputs.

### 🎮 Software Logic (C)
* **Hangman Game:** Demonstrates string manipulation, character array handling, and complex conditional logic for game-state management.
* **Guessing Game:** Focused on control flow, loops, and pseudo-random number generation (rand/srand).

### 🚀 C++ Mastery (Alura Specialization Series)
A comprehensive journey through modern C++, covering 5 modules of software engineering principles:
* **STL & Fundamentals:** Effective use of standard containers, iterators, and algorithms.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Deep dive into Classes, Methods, Encapsulation, and Header/Implementation file separation.
* **Advanced Architecture:** Utilizing Inheritance and Polymorphism for scalable and reusable code.
* **Modern Features:** Practical application of Enums, Templates, and advanced memory handling.

## 🛠️ Technical Competencies
* **Languages:** C, C++ (Modern standards), Arduino Framework.
* **Concepts:** PWM Control, State Machines, Object-Oriented Design (OOD), Memory Management.
* **Tools:** GCC/G++, Arduino IDE, CLion/VS Code.
